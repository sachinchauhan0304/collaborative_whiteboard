- Save & Export: Provide the ability to save the whiteboard content as an image or PDF file for later use.
- Canvas Management: Enable users to undo and redo actions, as well as a button to clear the entire canvas.
- Intelligent Backgrounds: Ability to change backgrounds and add images using the built in tool, or by generating background via generative AI. Uses a tool to decide whether to generate an appropriate background for a collaborative sketching session, if the users haven't provided their own.
